
I am a recent Computer Science graduate from Bloomsburg University and soon to be
PhD student at the University of Rochester with hopes to concentrate in High-Performance Computing. 
I have interests and experience in the low-level areas such as compilers, operating systems,
and the design and implementation of high-performance data structures. My love for
computer science extends to both theory and application, and as such I am very fond of
producing the higher-level abstractions that provide quality-of-life.

I am a previous [Google Summer of Code student](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/6530769430249472/)
for Cray's Chapel programming language, and I am now a [Rails Girls Summer of Code coach](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2018-08-07-team-sectumsempra).
I currently am an intern for [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)](https://www.pnnl.gov/), stationed at
[Northwest Institute for Advanced Computing (NIAC)](https://www.niac-uw.org/), where I am working on a collaborative
project between Cray and PNNL on improving the Chapel programming language to better support irregular applications such as graph algorithms.

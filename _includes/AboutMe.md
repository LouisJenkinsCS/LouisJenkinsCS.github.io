
I am a recent Computer Science graduate from Bloomsburg University. I have a strong
desire to obtain my PhD with a concentration in High-Performance Computing. I have
interests and experience in the low-level areas such as compilers, operating systems,
and the design and implementation of high-performance data structures. My love for
computer science extends to both theory and application, and as such I am very fond of
producing the higher-level abstractions that provide quality-of-life.

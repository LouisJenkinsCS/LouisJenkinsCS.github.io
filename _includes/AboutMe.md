I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Rochester](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/), and a [Fellow of the Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DoE CSGF)](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/fellows/profile?n=jenkins2019). My research is centered around Interactivity in High Performance Computing, which involves the optimization of the scheduling decisions in interactive applications, such as Jupyter Notebooks, at boundary of individual Jupyter Notebook cells. See more information on my research [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/research). I have obtained my B.S. in Computer Science from [Bloomsburg University](https://www.bloomu.edu/academics/programs/computer-science-bs), and my M.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Rochester](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/).

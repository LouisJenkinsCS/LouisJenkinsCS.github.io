I obtained my Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science from [Bloomsburg University](http://www.bloomu.edu/computer-science),
and currently am pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Rochester](https://www.cs.rochester.edu). My advisor is
[Michael L. Scott](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~scott/) and my current line of research, as stated 
[here](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/news-events/news/2019-04-17_jenkins_csgf.html), is focused on leveraging persistent memory
to enhance both productivity and performance of fault-tolerant systems in high-performance computing applications. I am a [fellow
](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/fellows/profile?n=jenkins2019) of the [Department of Energy's Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/).

I have participated as a student in Google Summer of Code 2017 for Cray's exascale programming language called 'Chapel', where I created
the language's first [Distributed Data Structures](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/6530769430249472/) that enabled Global-View Programming, similar to Chapel's distributed arrays. I later became a [Rails Girls Summer of Code coach](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2018-08-07-team-sectumsempra) for Chapel in 2018 and later was a [Google Summer of Code mentor](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5877554395742208/) for Chapel in 2019. Formerly, I was a Chapel-specialist and part-time consultant for Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where I worked on the [Chapel HyperGraph Library (CHGL)](https://www.osti.gov/doecode/biblio/18401) and in collaboration with [HyperNetX (HNX)](https://www.osti.gov/doecode/biblio/22160) in an exploration of DNS names and relationships as hypergraphs.

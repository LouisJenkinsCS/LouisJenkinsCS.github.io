## About Me

My name is Louis Jenkins, and I am a Computer Science undergraduate. After graduation,
I hope to obtain my PhD in Computer Science and hopefully research and publish something
substantial. I favor the academic and theoretical sides of Computer Science, although
I am no stranger to software engineering.

## Interests

My interests change with time so this list is not set in stone. Below are my specific
interests in certain topics of Computer Science, along with my experience in them.

### Systems Programming

My experience with systems programming stems from my fascination in figuring out
how things work. Like how an impassioned engineering is born from taking things apart and putting
them back together again, my fascination is from building them from the ground up.

My current experiences with Systems Programmming is rather limited but intense: I like
Operating Systems, and I want to find out how they work, and so I began building it
from the ground up. More information can be seen [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects).

### Concurrent Computing

My experience with concurrent computing began small but grew with time. It began with pthreads, later
to creating my own thread-pool, to creating simple lock-free data structures, to
even [creating a novel concurrent data structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/A_Concurrent_Map_for_Go.pdf).

While I am no stranger to concurrency, I am not master, and mastery is what I seek.

### Compilers, Language, and Runtime Systems Design

Like my fascination in Systems Programming, I am interested in how languages are
made and designed, how compilers scan and parse as well as optimize, and how runtime
systems glue it all together. I have observed and modified Go's runtime to add a
[concurrent map]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects). I have also created a very minimal JVM in Haskell,
also seen [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects).

## About Me

I'm an ambitious Computer Science major with hopes to acquire a PhD in distributed,
parallel, and concurrent computing, but I also share an interest in systems programming,
compilers, and runtime systems. I also bear a strong desire to create useful and
novel solutions to problems, whether they be academic or industry related.
Please see my previous [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects) for records of
experience in those areas, and see my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdf/resume.pdf)
for a quick summary.

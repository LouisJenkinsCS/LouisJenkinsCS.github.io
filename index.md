I am a current Computer Science undergraduate student with ambitions to obtain my Ph.D.
My interests float towards the theory side of Computer Science, such as systems programming,
concurrent and parallel processing, and compiler and runtime systems design. With so many
fascinating areas of Computer Science, it's hard to have an actual favorite, and this list
most likely will change with time.

Miscallaneous Utilities for the C Programming Language, or Misc\+\_\+\+Utils, is a collection, albeit a small one, of utilities that aren\textquotesingle{}t big enough to deserve it\textquotesingle{}s own package.

Inside, it contains basic logging macros to log information to a file, a debugging macro to output information to stderr in a prettified format. It should also be noted that the logging functions also show the name of the file and the line where the macro is invoked, thanks to G\+C\+C magic.

Inside also is a timer, which is extremely bare bones for now, and allows you to start, stop and obtain the total time in string format.\hypertarget{index_list_features}{}\section{Features}\label{index_list_features}

Misc\+\_\+\+Utils allows you to log information to disk, as well as the line number and name of the file. It also allows you to time your programs as well. Misc\+\_\+\+Utils also features a very simple debug macro for if you don\textquotesingle{}t want to log to a file and just want to log to stderr, in fact, you can even log everything to stdout or stderr as well.

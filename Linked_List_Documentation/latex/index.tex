This Linked List differs from other minimal implementations in that it is not exactly minimal, in fact it\textquotesingle{}s full of features normally neglected by others in favor for performance and smaller size. Not to say my Linked List is the slowest, but it surely isn\textquotesingle{}t the fastest, in fact, it favors for more general and generic everyday use overall.

Why not try an already tested and implemented linked list? Need to iterate over all items in a list? Covered! Need a dynamically resizing container? Covered! Need a small or medium amount of items to be sorted with no hassle for performance? Covered! Anything you can think of, it\textquotesingle{}s all here!$\ast$

\hypertarget{index_list_summary}{}\section{Summary}\label{index_list_summary}
The Thread Pool in this package will allow you to, the developer, to abstract the need to handle threads and their lifetimes by leaving it up to my thread pool implementation. Unlike other thread pools available for C, this one offers the ability to pause/resume and obtain the result from a task submitted.\hypertarget{index_list_features}{}\section{Features}\label{index_list_features}
\hypertarget{index_results}{}\subsection{Get Results!}\label{index_results}
This thread pool returns a \hyperlink{struct_result}{Result} struct which allows you to wait on the returned value from a task. This feature is entirely optional, tasks can be flagged to not to return a result, hence eliminating the need to handle memory management of the result.\hypertarget{index_pause_and_resume}{}\subsection{Pause all tasks to be resumed later!}\label{index_pause_and_resume}
Pause all tasks to be resumed later. Tasks can also be flagged to not be paused, hence the thread processing it will pause only after it finishes.\hypertarget{index_priority}{}\subsection{Prioritize your tasks!}\label{index_priority}
Allows you to submit a higher priority task ahead of the tasks of lower priority.\hypertarget{index_recover}{}\subsection{Recovery from segmentation faults and errors (\+Future)}\label{index_recover}
The Thread Pool can continue operation and just terminate the current thread, spawning a new one to take it\textquotesingle{}s place, either resuming other tasks abort all tasks and cleanup at the user\textquotesingle{}s choice.\hypertarget{index_parameters}{}\subsection{Dynamic parameters based on the flags you want!}\label{index_parameters}
Use of bitmasking to pass multiple flags as a parameter, with it\textquotesingle{}s own default behavior if you exclude them.\hypertarget{index_notes}{}\section{Notes and Disclaimers}\label{index_notes}
There can, safely, only be one instance of this thread pool, as it\textquotesingle{}s thread pool struct is a static variable.

## Peer's Choice for Outstanding Project Award

Awarded for my excellent work on the project "A Scalable Built-in Hash-Table for the Go Programming Language",
detailed [here](/projects/#go_map). This award was award from Lehigh University's "Smart Spaces", an
N.S.F (National Science Foundation) sponsored R.E.U (Research Experience for Undergraduates), where I had
competed against and outperformed other selected students from more prestigious universities, and alone vs groups
of 2s and 3s at that. It is something I am very proud of, and has formed a valuable connection with my
advisor at the time, Michael F. Spear.

Following this award, I was featured in an article for Bloomsburg University, seen [here](http://bloomsburgu.tumblr.com/post/150972457332/louis-jenkinss-internship-with-lehigh).

## Honorable Mention for the 2017 Outstanding Undergraduate Researchers Award

Following my Peer's Choice for Outstanding Project Award, Michael Spear, who was so impressed with my work, pushed for me to become nominated by my university as a non-PhD granting

Princeton, and others for Computer Science research. 2017's awards was sponsored by Microsoft Research. The awards can be seen in the 2017 section of [this](http://cra.org/about/awards/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award/) page.

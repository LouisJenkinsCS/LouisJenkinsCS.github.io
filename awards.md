### Pacific Northwest National Laboratory - Outstanding Performance Award

I was nominated by Cliff Joslyn, Chief Scientist for Knowledge Sciences at Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory, for my work on producing the prototype of the CHGL <~> HNX pipeline during
ridiculously tight deadline of two weeks, while also doing my first year of graduate school.
I believe I worked at least 80 hours those two weeks and worked sun-up sun-down, and so this
is very well-deserved.

### University of Rochester - Departmental Outstanding Graduate Teaching Assistant Award

Given award for my role as graduate Teaching Assistant for Michael Scott's "Parallel and Distributed
Computing" and "Programming Language, Design, and Implementation" course. During the former, I invited
Brad Chamberlain, Technical Lead of the Chapel programming language and Principle Engineer of Cray (now
a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company), to introduce himself and the Chapel programming language to set
the basis for a programming assignment that I designed and developed on implementing Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) utilizing Delta Stepping ([graph generator](https://gist.github.com/LouisJenkinsCS/305c1201b352ce672ea183122f123085) and [base for assignment](https://gist.github.com/LouisJenkinsCS/385fb7c9b031fc36328b70ed9fffef4b)), where students implement them in both Chapel and MPI. In the latter class,
I was responsible for overseeing undergraduate TA's and primarily developed the autograders, including one [testing time complexity of data structures](https://gist.github.com/LouisJenkinsCS/2123e21d967ba779c76bf87c05bf88c4).

During my last semester of undergrad, I was approved for a small research grant
called the [Professional Experience Grant](https://intranet.bloomu.edu/professionalu-grant)
where I was provided a $2,000 stipend with an additional $1,000 for other expenses.
This essentially turned my 'Independent Study' into a full-blown REU experience,
where I was receiving both cash *and* credit. The idea for my project was actually
inspired by Azul System's new 'Zing Falcon JIT Compiler', which used LLVM as a
backend and boasts performance improvements up to 250% over Oracle's HotSpot; to
provide a more staggering comparison, HotSpot owns 99% of the market while Zing
comprises less than 1%. I decided to dedicate my project to learn more and more
about LLVM, compilation optimizations and techniques, and on constructing the
frontend.
